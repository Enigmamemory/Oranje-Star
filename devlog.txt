Obstacles overcome:

- ALL THE BUGS. ALL OF THEM. WHY. If I had to describe all of them, we'll be talking here all day.
- The incredible progress we made on Thursday in particular.
- Managing to make a working terminal interface (Used YoRPG as a basis).

Unresolved issues:

- What is GUI. Hah. Hah. Hah.
- Never got to make an actual map. It's time we handed this in, but I regret this.
- The balancing for this game is all off. It couldn't be helped, but if this game was actually played, so many things are gamebreaking.
- In the driver, the difference between parseInt and simply in.readLine() may cause exception errors at different points from different things.
- This interface is cumbersome to use.

Cool Stuff learned:

- Making a working interactive Driver (Much better than my first attempt - Alex)
- Some stuff on GUIs
- Perservation
- BELIEVEEEEEEEEEEE

Mid-development changes:

- We had to drop the GUI, first and foremost.
- There were some more mild changes which all contributed to making the interface extremely manual.

Lessons learned:

- No, Chris, you NEVER try to bank on a snow day. What were you thinking? -_-
- Working on a GUI during the weekend? BAD IDEA DUDE. BAD IDEA.
- This isn't sophomore year, we don't have a million years and beyond to do this project.
- Handing things in late when everyone elses handed it in on time feels awful.
